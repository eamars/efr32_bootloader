name=Enhanced Beacon Request Library
description=This library implements the 802.15.4 Enhanced Beacon Request generation and processing for ZigBee.  An Enhanced Beacon request is a 802.15.4 MAC Command of Beacon Request with Frame Version 2 and including Information Elemets (IEs) embedded in the MAC header.  This allows for the stack to perform scans and request that the receiver of the MAC Beacon Request Command only respond in certain circumstacnces, such as only if the receiver has Permit Joining = TRUE.  It also allows sending a beacon request with an Extended PAN ID included so that when rejoining the device will only hear beacons from the network it belongs to.  This feature is not yet certifiable within ZigBee.
