    description="EmberZNet: Lists PC Host APIs used to interface to the EmberZNet stack, HAL, and status of the  application-controlled network. These APIs concern network management, device and stack configuration, message  fragmentation, serial communication, ASH (Asynchronus Serial Host) utilities, and others. They are independent  of the Application Framework and therefore can be used for developing applications that do not rely on the ZigBee  Cluster Library."
