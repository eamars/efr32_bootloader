 * will be true and the application should only issue EZSP commands that affect
 * memory allocation on the NCP.  For example, tables on the NCP can be resized
 * in the first call.  In the second invocation, memoryAllocation will be false
 * and the application should only issue EZSP commands that do not affect memory
 * allocation.  For example, tables on the NCP can be populated in the second
 * call.  This callback is not called on SoCs.
