scanDuration.name=Scan duration exponent
scanDuration.description=The exponent of the number of scan periods, where a scan period is 960 symbols, and a symbol is 16 miscroseconds.  The scan will occur for ((2^duration) + 1) scan periods.
scanDuration.type=NUMBER:0,14
scanDuration.default=4
# For default value, see Base Device specification (13-0402) section 6.2.11.

channelMask.name=Channel mask
channelMask.description=The channels that the plugin will scan when forming and joining.
channelMask.type=CHANNELS
channelMask.default=0x02108800
# For default value, see Base Device specification (13-0402) section 6.2.10.

channelBeaconsThreshold.name=Channel beacons threshold
channelBeaconsThreshold.description=This is the highest number of beacons that the network creator will hear on a channel and still try to form a network. If the network creator hears more than this ammount of beacons on one channel, it will disregard this channel from the formation process.
channelBeaconsThreshold.type=NUMBER:0,255
channelBeaconsThreshold.default=5

radioPower.name=Radio power to use on the formed network.
radioPower.description=This is the default radio power that will be used on the network. The units are in dBm.
