/** @brief Returns a true if the manufacturing library token has been set.
 *
 * Function to return whether the manufacturing library token has currently
 * been set.  Reference designs are programmed to initiate off scan/join
 * behavoir as soon as the device has been powered up.  Certain sleepy devices,
 * such as security sensors, may also use the UART for manufacturing, which
 * becomes inactive during normal operation.  Setting this token will allow
 * the device to stay awake or hold off on normal joining behavior for a few
 * seconds to allow manufacturing mode to be enabled.  The last step in the 
 * manufacturing process would be to disable this token.
 *
 * Note:  this token is disabled by default.  If you wish to enable it by
 * default in your application, you must edit the file 
 * app/framework/plugin/mfg-lib/mfg-lib-tokens.h.
 *
 * @return A ::bool value that is true if the manufacturing library token
 * has been set and false if it has not been set.
