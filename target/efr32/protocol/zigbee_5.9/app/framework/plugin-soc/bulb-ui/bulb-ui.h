 *
 * This funciton will kick off the bulb-ui search for joinable networks.  This
 * is not normally required, as the bulb-ui will do this automatically.
 * However, for some plugins, that interrupt the normal bulb-ui behavior, 
 * such as the manufacturing library cluster server, they may need to kick off
 * a network search when their task is complete.
