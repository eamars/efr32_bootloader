 *
 * @{

 * An event queue is a queue of events that will be run at some future time(s).
 * The Event type is declared in core/ember-stack.h and has three fields:
 *
 @verbatim
 EventActions *actions;      // see below
 Event *next;                // internal use only, but must be
                             //  initialized to NULL
 uint32_t timeToExecute;       // internal use only
 @endverbatim
 *
 * The EventAction struct also has three fields:
 *
 @verbatim
 struct EventQueue_s *queue; // the queue this event goes on
 void (*handler)(Event *);   // called when the event fires
 void (*marker)(Event *);    // marking fuction, can be NULL
 @endverbatim
 *
 * The marker function is needed if an event refers to a buffer or is
 * itself a buffer; see the dynamic event example below.
 *
 *
 * Sample static event declaration:
 *
 @verbatim
 static void fooEventHandler(Event *event);
 static EventActions fooEventActions = {
   &emStackEventQueue,
   fooEventHandler,
   NULL          // no marking function is needed
 };

 Initialize the event as unscheduled.
 static Event fooEvent = { &fooEventActions, NULL };

 static void fooEventHandler(Event *event)
 {
   ...
 }
 @endverbatim
 *
 * Sample dynamic event:
 @verbatim
 
 typedef struct {
   Event event;
   PacketHeader someBuffer;
   // plus other values as needed
 } BarEvent;
 
 static void barEventHandler(BarEvent *event);
 static void barEventMarker(BarEvent *event);
 
 static EventActions barEventActions = {
   &emStackEventQueue,
   (void (*)(Event *)) barEventHandler,
   (void (*)(Event *)) barEventMarker // required for all dynamic events
 };
 
 static void barEventHandler(BarEvent *event)
 {
   ...
 };
 
 static void barEventMarker(BarEvent *event)
 {
   // The Buffer that holds BarEvent itself is not marked, but any Buffers
   // within the BarEvent must be marked.  If BarEvent doesn't contain any
   // Buffers, the marking function is still required, but will be empty.
   emMarkBuffer(&event->someBuffer);
 }
 
 static void addBarEvent(Buffer someBuffer, uint32_t delayMs)
 {
   Buffer eventBuffer = emAllocateBuffer(sizeof(BarEvent));
   if (eventBuffer == NULL_BUFFER) {
     return;
   }
   BarEvent *barEvent = (BarEvent *) emGetBufferPointer(eventBuffer);
   barEvent->event.actions = &barEventActions;
   barEvent->event.next = NULL;       // initialize as unscheduled
   barEvent->someBuffer = someBuffer;
   emberEventSetDelayMs((Event *) barEvent, delayMs);
 }
 @endverbatim

 * Cancelling a dynamic event:
 @verbatim

 static bool barEventPredicate(Event *event,
                                  void *castBuffer)
 {
   return (((BarEvent *) event)->someBuffer) == (Buffer) castBuffer;
 }
 
 static void cancelBarEvent(Buffer someBuffer)
 {
   emberFindEvent(&emStackEventQueue,
                  &barEventActions,
                  barEventPredicate,
                  (void *) someBuffer);
 }
 @endverbatim
 * Delays greater than this will cause the scheduled execution time to
 * wrap around into the past and the event will be executed immediately.
