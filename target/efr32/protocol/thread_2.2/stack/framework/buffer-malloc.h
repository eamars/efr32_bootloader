// An implementation of malloc() and free() that uses buffers.  malloc()
// returns a pointer to the contents of a buffer.  Freed buffers are kept
// on a list and reused; a new buffer is allocated only if no buffer on
// the freelist is large enough to be used.
//
// The buffers are not marked by this code.  emMallocFreeList must be
// set to NULL_BUFFER before calling emReclaimUnusedBuffers().

extern Buffer emMallocFreeList;
