/** @brief Enables boost power mode and/or the alternate transmit path.
  *
  * Boost power mode is a high performance radio mode
  * which offers increased transmit power and receive sensitivity at the cost of
  * an increase in power consumption.  The alternate transmit output path allows
  * for simplified connection to an external power amplifier via the
  * RF_TX_ALT_P and RF_TX_ALT_N pins on the em250.  ::emberInit() calls this
  * function using the power mode and transmitter output settings as specified
  * in the MFG_PHY_CONFIG token (with each bit inverted so that the default
  * token value of 0xffff corresponds to normal power mode and bi-directional RF
  * transmitter output).  The application only needs to call
  * ::emberSetTxPowerMode() if it wishes to use a power mode or transmitter output
  * setting different from that specified in the MFG_PHY_CONFIG token.
  * After this initial call to ::emberSetTxPowerMode(), the stack
  * will automatically maintain the specified power mode configuration across
  * sleep/wake cycles.
  *
  * @note This function does not alter the MFG_PHY_CONFIG token.  The
  * MFG_PHY_CONFIG token must be properly configured to ensure optimal radio
  * performance when the standalone bootloader runs in recovery mode.  The
  * MFG_PHY_CONFIG can only be set using external tools.  IF YOUR PRODUCT USES
  * BOOST MODE OR THE ALTERNATE TRANSMITTER OUTPUT AND THE STANDALONE BOOTLOADER
  * YOU MUST SET THE PHY_CONFIG TOKEN INSTEAD OF USING THIS FUNCTION.
  * Contact support@ember.com for instructions on how to set the MFG_PHY_CONFIG
  * token appropriately.
  *
  * @param txPowerMode  Specifies which of the transmit power mode options are
  * to be activated.  This parameter should be set to one of the literal values
  * described in stack/include/ember-types.h.  Any power option not specified 
  * in the txPowerMode parameter will be deactivated.
  * 
  * @return ::EMBER_SUCCESS if successful; an error code otherwise.

/** @brief The radio calibration callback function.
 *
 * The Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) can drift with
 * temperature changes.  During every call to ::emberTick(), the stack will
 * check to see if the VCO has drifted.  If the VCO has drifted, the stack
 * will call ::emberRadioNeedsCalibratingHandler() to inform the application
 * that it should perform calibration of the current channel as soon as
 * possible.  Calibration can take up to 150ms.  The default callback function
 * implementation provided here performs calibration immediately.  If the
 * application wishes, it can define its own callback by defining
 * ::EMBER_APPLICATION_HAS_CUSTOM_RADIO_CALIBRATION_CALLBACK in its
 * CONFIGURATION_HEADER.  It can then failsafe any critical processes or
 * peripherals before calling ::emberCalibrateCurrentChannel().  The
 * application must call ::emberCalibrateCurrentChannel() in
 * response to this callback to maintain expected radio performance.

  * of the ::emberRadioNeedsCalibratingHandler() callback function.  Calibration
  * can take up to 150ms.  Note if this function is called when the radio is
  * off, it will turn the radio on and leave it on.
