 * @section Host and NCP Sleep Communication
 *
 * When a host sends a SLEEP_NO_TIMER_COMMAND to an NCP, the following occurs:
 *
 * Host sends SLEEP_NO_TIMER_COMMAND
 * NCP sends CB_SLEEP_NO_TIMER_COMMAND
 *
 * If the communication link between the Host and NCP is SPI, then as soon as
 * the NCP finishes sending CB_SLEEP_NO_TIMER_COMMAND, it will allow itself to
 * sleep.
 *
 * If the communication link between the Host and NCP is a UART:
 *   The Host's ASH ACKs the CB_SLEEP_NO_TIMER_COMMAND.
 *   NCP receives the ACK and clears CB_SLEEP_NO_TIMER_COMMAND from its UART
 *   buffers.
 *   Since its UART buffers are now empty, it will allow itself to sleep.
 *
 * For the LISTEN_COMMAND, the behavior is the same as in SLEEP_NO_TIMER_COMMAND,
 * except the NCP sends a  CB_LISTEN_COMMAND in response instead of
 * CB_SLEEP_NO_TIMER_COMMAND.

 *
