//  Todo:
//  - explain how to use a configuration header
//  - the documentation of the custom handlers should
//    go in hal/ember-configuration.c, not here
//  - the stack profile documentation is out of date

/**
 * @addtogroup utilities
 *
 * All configurations have defaults, therefore many applications may not need
 * to do anything special.  However, you can override these defaults
 * by creating a CONFIGURATION_HEADER and within this header,
 * defining the appropriate macro to a different size.  For example, to
 * increase the child table size from 16 (the default) to 32:
 * @code
 * #define EMBER_CHILD_TABLE_SIZE 32
 * @endcode
 *
 * The convenience stubs provided in @c hal/ember-configuration.c can be overridden
 * by  defining the appropriate macro and providing the corresponding callback
 * function.  For example, an application with custom debug channel input must
 * implement @c emberDebugHandler() to process it.  Along with
 * the function definition, the application should provide the following
 * line in its CONFIGURATION_HEADER:
 * @code
 * #define EMBER_APPLICATION_HAS_DEBUG_HANDLER
 * @endcode
 *
 * See ember-configuration-defaults.h for source code.
