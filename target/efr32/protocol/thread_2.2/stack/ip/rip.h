  Notes

  This discussion assumes you've read http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1058.

  We assume the RIP network has at most 32 routers.  The address assignment,
  over-the-air message format, and internal implementation details all depend
  on this assumption.
  
  A RIP router has an id between 0 and 63, inclusive.  Its two byte short 
  mac id is formed by shifting its RIP id 10 bytes to the left.

  The maximum RIP metric value is 16.  

  We use a value of 0 (OTA and internally) to mean infinity (no route),
  rather than setting infinity to one more than the max metric value as is
  customary.  We do this to save bits over the air (0 is normally unused).

  A major design goal is to conserve bandwidth.  RIP update messages and 
  link quality information are combined in a single message, currently sent
  as an MLE advertisement with a new TLV type.  We want to keep these
  updates short, but certainly no larger than one 15.4 packet.  An over
  the air entry for each destination consists of a single byte: two bits
  for outgoing quality, two bits for incoming quality, and 4 bits for the RIP
  metric.  

  An incoming or outgoing quality of 0 means no link, either because the nodes
  cannot hear each other, or because they can but only too poorly to use.
  The other values for link cost correspond to poor (1), medium (2), and
  good (3) quality links.  As usual the outgoing link quality is obtained from
  the neighbor's incoming link quality and echoed back.  (Note: we are not 
  using the OTA outgoing cost, so if we don't come up with a use for it
  we should probably remove it.)  

  Currently we advertise all 32 route entries over the air at all times, so
  there is no need for garbage collection of infinite metric routes, or
  for a route change flag.

  Incoming link quality for a neighbor is derived from RSSI measurements on
  packets received from that neighbor.  Currently we assume a static noise
  floor of -95 dBm (this could be a problem), and use this to convert to
  a nonnegative link margin, which we store internally as a one byte rolling
  average.  Based on empirical data from the EM357, link margin is mapped
  to incoming link cost as follows:

    quality 3: >20 dBm
    quality 2: >10 dBm
    quality 1: >2  dBm
    quality 0: <= 2 dBm

  The total link cost (generally referred to simply as link cost) for a 
  neighbor is derived from the incoming and outgoing link quality, with an 
  added penalty for elderly links described below. See the linkCost[][]
  table in rip-neighbor.c for the mapping.  The total link cost is added 
  to a neighbor's route cost to determine our route cost.

  An age timer is incremented every 30 seconds for neighbors that have been
  heard from.  It is reset to 0 upon receipt of an update from the neighbor.
  Incoming link cost is penalized in steps as neighbors get older.  
  At RIP_MAX_AGE, the link quality fields are set to 0, indicating the node
  is no longer a neighbor.

  Todo
 
  Should we reset the age upon receipt of any packet from the neighbor?
  (Probably not... then the age would no longer truly serve as an age for
  the route, because a link's age could keep getting reset even though we
  hadn't actually heard an update for a long time, and that update might
  have indicated that the neighbor's route to a destination had gotten 
  worse or gone away, but we wouldn't know.)

  Currently we store our metric to each destination, which is obtained by
  summing the next hop's metric to the destination with our link cost to the
  next hop.  Instead, we could simply store the next hop's metric to the 
  destination, and perform the sum ourselves when needed (essentially only
  when we send out an update).  This would make it so that changes in link 
  cost would be immediately reflected in all the metric values that used 
  that link as a next hop, rather than waiting for the next update across that
  link (which may never come if the link is aging out).  This would speed up
  switching to a better route without any additional overhead.

  I'm considering keeping a backup next hop.  Currently if our next
  hop to a destination fails, we have to wait for an update from another
  neighbor to fix the route.  A backup would allow us to immediately fail over.
  We'd have to store 5 bits for the backup next hop, and 4 bits for the metric
  via that next hop, so about 36 bytes of RAM.  It would also add a little flash
  and some complexity.  In order to minimize loops, our metric via the backup
  cannot exceed our metric via the primary.  We would continue to advertise 
  only the primary metric in updates.  Empirical study should help determine
  whether this feature is worth implementing.

  To help avoid loops, the RIP RFC uses split horizon with poison reverse,
  in which the update you send to a given neighbor advertises an infinite cost
  to any destination for which that neighbor is your next hop.  We can't do
  it that way because we broadcast a single update to all of our neighbors.
  However we need to do something since the situation of two nodes temporarily
  choosing each other as next hops occurs easily, which I have observerd.
  One option is to include our next hop to each destination in each update
  message.  This would increase the update payload from 32 bytes to 52 or 64
  bytes, depending on whether we respect byte boundaries.  Ouch.
  The reactive approach is to detect and fix loops when they happen.
  It saves protocol overhead at the cost of data reliability. But with a backup 
  next hop, the reliability hit would be mitigated.  There is a latency hit 
  on the data packet that detects the loop, but it is small and rare, nothing
  to be worried about.

  I think I need to be more careful about initializing the next hop to a
  special value when it is not valid (essentially, when the metric is 0).
  Currently it is initialized to 0, and after that it is not cleaned up
  when routes go away.  This shouldn't matter because it is not used for
  anything if the metric is 0, but it is a potential cause for confusion.

  We probably want a minimum link margin below which the link gets an 
  incoming cost of zero, and below which we do not initiate an MLE
  handshake.  There is an annoying phenomenon where MLE handshakes are
  initiated on a bad link, and fail.  We might need to keep a separate
  timer which throttles back the MLE requests, and for neighbors that
  have recently failed, only allows a new request to go out if the link
  margin has improved substantially.

  Loops greater than two hops.

  Mac duplicate detection bug?
