// File: retry.h
//
// Description: A queue for retrying and/or delaying outgoing packets.  
// This is independent of MAC layer retries.  A typical use is to retry
// MAC layer broadcasts, or to add initial jitter to any outgoing packet.
//
// There are really two queues: a "submit" queue for entries that have been 
// submitted to the mac, and a "delay" queue for entries with nonzero delay.
//
// This code was originally in grad/retry.c and has been made generic.

// (the delay queue) and one for messages ready to go out (the submit
// queue).  They are kept in the emRetryEntries[] array in queue order,
// first the submit queue and then the delay queue.  Moving the head
// of the delay queue to the tail of the submit queue can be done by
// decrementing delayCount and incrementing submitCount.  This is not
// a time-critical operation, but it helps to understand how the queues
// are represented.
