/** @brief Ok To Long Poll
 *
 * This function is called by the Polling plugin to determine if the node can
 * wait an extended period of time between polls.  Generally, a node can poll
 * infrequently when it does not expect to receive data, via its parent, from
 * other nodes in the network.  When data is expected, the node must poll more
 * frequently to avoid having its parent discard stale data due to the MAC
 * indirect transmission timeout (::EMBER_INDIRECT_TRANSMISSION_TIMEOUT).  The
 * application should return true if it is not expecting data or false
 * otherwise.
