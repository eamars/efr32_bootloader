/** @brief The radio calibration callback function.
 *
 * The Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) can drift with
 * temperature changes.  During every call to ::emberTick(), the stack will
 * check to see if the VCO has drifted.  If the VCO has drifted, the stack
 * will call ::emberRadioNeedsCalibratingHandler() to inform the application
 * that it should perform calibration of the current channel as soon as
 * possible.  Calibration can take up to 150ms.  The default callback function
 * implementation provided here performs calibration immediately.  If the
 * application wishes, it can define its own callback by defining
 * ::EMBER_APPLICATION_HAS_CUSTOM_RADIO_CALIBRATION_CALLBACK in its
 * CONFIGURATION_HEADER.  It can then failsafe any critical processes or
 * peripherals before calling ::emberCalibrateCurrentChannel().  The
 * application must call ::emberCalibrateCurrentChannel() in
 * response to this callback to maintain expected radio performance.
