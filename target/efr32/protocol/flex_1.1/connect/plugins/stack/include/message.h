 * - ::EMBER_INVALID_CALL if the node is not joined to a network, the packet
 * length is 0, the passed TX options indicates some feature feature that is not
 * supported or the passed endpoint exceeds ::EMBER_MAX_ENDPOINT.
 * - ::EMBER_MESSAGE_TOO_LONG if the message does not fit in a single frame;
 * - ::EMBER_PHY_TX_BUSY if the message cannot be sent since the node does not
 * support MAC queuing and the radio is currently busy.
 * - ::EMBER_MAC_TRANSMIT_QUEUE_FULL if the outgoing MAC queue is currently
 * full.
 * - ::EMBER_NO_BUFFERS if the stack could not allocate enough RAM to store the
 * submitted message.
 * - ::EMBER_MAC_UNKNOWN_DESTINATION if the node is part of a star network and
 * the destination node does not appear in the node's routing table.
 * - ::EMBER_MAC_SECURITY_NOT_SUPPORTED if the message was requested to be sent
 * out secured and either the local node does not support security or the
 * destination node is known to not support security.
 * - ::EMBER_MAC_BUSY if the message was not accepted because the MAC is 
 * currently performing some critical operation.
