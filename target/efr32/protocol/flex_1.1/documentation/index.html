<h2>Silicon Labs Flex Documentation</h2>

<h3>Release Notes / Quick Start Guides</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="qsg138-flex-efr32.pdf">Getting Started with the Silicon Labs Flex SDK for the Wireless Gecko (EFR32) Portfolio</a> -- QSG138</strong>
  <p>Flex: For the EFR32 portfolio, provides basic information on configuring, building, and installing applications using the Silicon Labs Flex SDK, which offers two paths to application development. One, using Silicon Labs Connect, provides a fully-featured, easily-customizable wireless networking solution. The other begins with Silicon Labs RAIL (Radio Abstraction Interface Layer), and offers a customizable radio interface layer designed to support proprietary or standards-based wireless protocols.
