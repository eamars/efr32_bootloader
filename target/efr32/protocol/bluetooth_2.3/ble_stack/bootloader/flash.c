 * This function will program one word into the on-chip flash.
 * Programming consists of ANDing the new data with the existing data; in
 * other words bits that contain 1 can remain 1 or be changed to 0, but bits
 * that are 0 can not be changed to 1.  Therefore, a word can be programmed
 * multiple times so long as these rules are followed; if a program operation
 * attempts to change a 0 bit to a 1 bit, that bit will not have its value
 * changed.
 *
 * This function will not return until the data has been programmed.
